# Scheme

## Project setup
Before importing the Schem project in Eclipse, make sure you have a working [FrameVM](https://www.github.com/metaborgcube/framevm) and [Dynamix](https://www.github.com/metaborg/metaborg-dynamix) installation.
After this you can import the relevant Dynamix projects using `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven projects`.
- `scheme`: The main project containing the syntax and Dynamix specification
- `scheme.example`: Example programs for various aspects of the language.
- `scheme.test`: Project containing tests. This project is currently empty
